# NumPy Array Datatype Converter

NumPy is a powerful library for scientific computing in Python. One of the features of numpy is its ability to efficiently work with arrays. However, sometimes it is necessary to convert a list of integers into a numpy array with a specified datatype. In this challenge, you will be required to write a Python function that converts a list of integers into a numpy array with a specified datatype. This will test your understanding of numpy and data types in Python.
