# Array Attributes and Dtype

This tutorial will explore NumPy array attributes, focusing on the `dtype` attribute. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python, and the NumPy array is a core data structure for this library.

## Introduction to NumPy Arrays

NumPy arrays are multidimensional, homogeneous arrays, which means they can store elements of the same data type in multiple dimensions. They are efficient and convenient for numerical operations, providing many functions and capabilities.
