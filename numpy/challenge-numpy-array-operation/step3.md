# Calculate Total Revenue

Write a function called `calculate_revenue_totals` that takes in a NumPy array `transactions` and returns the following values:

- `'total_revenue_by_customer'`: A NumPy array of shape `(num_customers,)` containing the total revenue generated by each customer.
- `'total_revenue_by_product'`: A NumPy array of shape `(num_products,)` containing the total revenue generated by each product.

## Example

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample transaction data
transactions = np.array([[3, 4, 1],
                         [0, 2, 5],
                         [1, 2, 2]])

# Define the prices for each product
prices = np.array([2.99, 1.99, 4.99])

# Calculate the total number of purchases by customer and by product
total_purchases_by_customer, total_purchases_by_product = calculate_purchase_totals(transactions)

# Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer and product
total_revenue_by_customer, total_revenue_by_product = calculate_revenue_totals(total_purchases_by_customer total_purchases_by_product, prices)

# Print the results
print("Total revenue by customer:", total_revenue_by_customer)
print("Total revenue by product:", total_revenue_by_product)

# Total revenue by customer: [34.88 19.87 14.94]
# Total revenue by product: [11.93 15.92 39.92]

```
