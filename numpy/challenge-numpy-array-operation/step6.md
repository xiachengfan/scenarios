# Customer Stats

Write a function called `customer_stats` that takes in a NumPy array `transactions` and returns a dictionary with the following keys and values:

- `'total_purchases_by_customer'`: A NumPy array of shape `(num_customers,)` containing the total number of purchases for each customer.
- `'total_purchases_by_product'`: A NumPy array of shape `(num_products,)` containing the total number of purchases for each product.
- `'total_revenue_by_customer'`: A NumPy array of shape `(num_customers,)` containing the total revenue generated by each customer.
- `'total_revenue_by_product'`: A NumPy array of shape `(num_products,)` containing the total revenue generated by each product.
- `'average_purchases_per_customer'`: A float representing the average number of purchases per customer.
- `'average_purchases_per_product'`: A float representing the average number of purchases per product.

## Example

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> transactions = np.array([
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [0, 1, 0],
...     [4, 0, 2]
... ])
>>> customer_stats(transactions)
{
    'total_purchases_by_customer': array([6, 1, 6]),
    'total_purchases_by_product': array([5, 3, 5]),
    'total_revenue_by_customer': array([ 60,   0,  60]),
    'total_revenue_by_product': array([20, 30, 20]),
    'average_purchases_per_customer': 4.33,
    'average_purchases_per_product': 2.67
}
```
