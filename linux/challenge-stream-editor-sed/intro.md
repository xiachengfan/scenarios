# Stream Editor Sed

This challenge will test your knowledge of the `sed` command, a powerful text manipulation tool available in Linux. The challenge will be divided into several steps, each one building on the previous step.

## Introduction

`sed` stands for Stream Editor and is a powerful command-line tool that can perform a wide range of text manipulation functions, including search and replace, deleting lines, inserting and appending text, and more.

`sed` works by reading text from standard input (stdin) or a file, performing a specified operation on the text, and then outputting the result to standard output (stdout) or a file.
