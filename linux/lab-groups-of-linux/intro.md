# Groups of Linux

Welcome to the lab on Groups of Linux. Linux groups are an essential feature for managing user access and permissions. In this lab, you will learn how to create and delete groups, as well as manage group membership using `groupadd` and `groupdel` commands.

For the purpose of this lab, we will use the following specific user name and group name:

- User name: `johndoe`
- Group name: `devs`
