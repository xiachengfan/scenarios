# Summary

Congratulations, you have completed the lab on Groups of Linux. You should now have a good understanding of how to manage groups on a Linux system, including how to create new groups, add users to groups, and delete existing groups.

Remember to always use caution when making changes to the system, especially when working with user and group permissions. With great power comes great responsibility!
