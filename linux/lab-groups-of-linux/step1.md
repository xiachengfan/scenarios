## Understanding Linux Groups

The `groups` command displays the groups that a user belongs to. This command can be useful for troubleshooting permission issues and verifying that a user has the correct group memberships.

To use the `groups` command, simply type the following into the terminal:

```bash
groups johndoe
```

This should display the groups that the `johndoe` user belongs to.
