## Creating Groups

The `groupadd` command is used to create a new group on a Linux system. This command requires root privileges, so you will need to use `sudo` to run it.

To create a new group, type the following into the terminal:

```bash
sudo groupadd devs
```

This will create a new group named `devs`.
