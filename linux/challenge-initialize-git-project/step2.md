## Introduction

## Target

- To clone an existing repository `https://github.com/github/gitignore` using `git clone`.

## Result Example

To clone an existing repository, navigate to the `~/Code` directory where you want to clone the repository.

This will create a new directory containing the repository's files and subdirectories.

```bash
Cloning into 'gitignore'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 8094, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (171/171), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (118/118), done.
remote: Total 8094 (delta 78), reused 106 (delta 46), pack-reused 7923
Receiving objects: 100% (8094/8094), 2.81 MiB | 1.90 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4074/4074), done.
```
