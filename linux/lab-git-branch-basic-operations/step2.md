# Renaming and Deleting Branches

If you want to rename a branch, use the `branch` command with the `-m` option followed by the new name:

```bash
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

To delete a branch, use the `branch` command with the `-d` option followed by the name of the branch you want to delete:

```bash
git branch -d branch-to-delete
```
