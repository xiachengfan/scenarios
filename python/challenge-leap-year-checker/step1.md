# Leap Year Checker

Write a function called `is_leap_year` that takes a year (an integer) as an argument and returns `True` if the year is a leap year, and `False` otherwise. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.

## Example Usage

```python
>>> print(is_leap_year(2020)) # True
>>> print(is_leap_year(2100)) # False
>>> print(is_leap_year(2000)) # True
```

## TODO

- Complete `is_leap_year.py`

## Requirements

- The input year should be an integer.
- The output should be a boolean value (`True` or `False`)
- The function should implement the criteria for a leap year as described above.
