# Advanced Math Operations

In this sub-challenge, you will extend the MathExpression class from Sub-Challenge 1 to support more advanced mathematical operations. Specifically, you will implement the following magic methods:

- `__pow__`: Raises one instance of the class to the power of another.
- `__mod__`: Returns the modulo of one instance of the class by another.
- `__floordiv__`: Returns the floor division of one instance of the class by another.

## TODO

Extend the `MathExpression` class in `advanced_math_operations.py` to support the new magic methods described above. Then, test your class by creating instances and performing mathematical operations on them.
