# Unary Operators

In this sub-challenge, you will extend the MathExpression class from Sub-Challenge 3 to support unary operators like negation and absolute value. Specifically, you will implement the following magic methods:

- `__neg__`: Returns the negation of the instance of the class.
- `__pos__`: Returns the positive value of the instance of the class.
- `__abs__`: Returns the absolute value of the instance of the class.

## TODO

Extend the `MathExpression` class in `unary_operators.py` to support the new unary operator magic methods described above. Then, test your class by creating instances and performing unary operations on them.
