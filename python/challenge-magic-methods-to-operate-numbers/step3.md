# Comparisons

In this sub-challenge, you will extend the MathExpression class from Sub-Challenge 2 to support comparisons between instances of the class. Specifically, you will implement the following magic methods:

- `__eq__`: Determines if two instances of the class are equal.
- `__ne__`: Determines if two instances of the class are not equal.
- `__lt__`: Determines if one instance of the class is less than another.
- `__le__`: Determines if one instance of the class is less than or equal to another.
- `__gt__`: Determines if one instance of the class is greater than another.
- `__ge__`: Determines if one instance of the class is greater than or equal to another.

## TODO

Extend the `MathExpression` class in `comparisons.py` to support the new comparison magic methods described above. Then, test your class by creating instances and comparing them.
