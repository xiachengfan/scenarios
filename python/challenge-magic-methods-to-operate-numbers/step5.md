# In-Place Operations

In this sub-challenge, you will extend the MathExpression class from Sub-Challenge 4 to support in-place mathematical operations like addition and subtraction. Specifically, you will implement the following magic methods:

- `__iadd__`: Adds another instance of the class to the current instance.
- `__isub__`: Subtracts another instance of the class from the current instance.
- `__imul__`: Multiplies another instance of the class with the current instance.
- `__itruediv__`: Divides the current instance by another instance of the class.

## TODO

Extend the `MathExpression` class in `in_place_operations.py` to support the new in-place mathematical operation magic methods described above. Then, test your class by creating instances and performing in-place mathematical operations on them.
