# Basic Math Operations

In this sub-challenge, you will create a Python class that represents a simple mathematical expression. The class should implement the following magic methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the class with an integer value.
- `__add__`: Adds two instances of the class together.
- `__sub__`: Subtracts one instance of the class from another.
- `__mul__`: Multiplies two instances of the class together.
- `__truediv__`: Divides one instance of the class by another.
- `__str__`: Returns a string representation of the value of the instance.

## TODO

- Create the `MathExpression` class in `basic_math_operations.py` and implement the magic methods and `__str__` method as described above. Then, test your class by creating instances and performing mathematical operations on them.
