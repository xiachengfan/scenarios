# Introduction to Python Assignments

In Python, assignment is the process of binding a name to an object. Assignment statements have the following general form:

```python
variable = expression
```

The expression on the right-hand side is evaluated, and its value is assigned to the variable on the left-hand side.

Let's look at a simple example:

## Simple Test

Open the Terminal and typing the following command in the terminal.

```bash
python3
```

Then, enter the following code.

```python
# Assign the value 42 to the variable 'x' and print it.
x = 42
print(x)
```

Output:

```python
42
```

Here, we assign the `x` to the variable `42` using the operator `=`. Then, we print the values of `x`.
