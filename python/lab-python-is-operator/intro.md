# Is Operator

The `is` operator in Python is used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory. This is different from the `==` operator, which checks if two variables have the same value. In this lab, we will explore how the `is` operator works and how it can be useful in Python programming.This is an important concept to understand, especially when working with mutable objects like lists and dictionaries. In this lab, we will explore the usage of the `is` operator in Python with simple and complex examples, and see how it can be used to write efficient and reliable code.
