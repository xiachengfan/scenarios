# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the `is` operator in Python and how it can be used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory. We explored the behavior of the `is` operator with both immutable and mutable objects, function parameters, and class instances. By understanding the `is` operator, we can write more efficient and reliable Python code.
