# Summary

After completing this challenge, you will have learned several important skills and concepts related to Python programming:

1. Defining and using functions in Python - You will learn how to define a function called `prime(n)` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise.
2. Implementing loops and conditional statements in Python - You will learn how to use Python's `for` loop and `if` statement to iterate over all numbers below 100 and determine whether each number is a prime number.
3. Applying mathematical operators in Python - You will learn how to use Python's mathematical operators, such as `%` for modulus and `**` for exponentiation, to implement the prime number checking logic.
4. Outputting results in Python - You will learn how to use the `print` function in Python to output the sum of all prime numbers below 100.

By completing this challenge, you will gain a deeper understanding of Python programming fundamentals and develop important skills that are essential for real-world programming tasks.
