# Advanced Math Expression Evaluator

In this challenge, you need to complete a more advanced function called `advanced_evaluate_expression`, which adds some new requirements compared to the `evaluate_expressionh` function.

## Requirements

Please complete the `advanced_evaluate_expression` function in the file `/home/labex/project/advanced_functionality.py`.

Sure, here's an enhanced version of the `evaluate_expression` function that supports the following additional features:

- On the basis of the `evaluate_expression` function, the effect that has been achieved before is still guaranteed to be achieved, with the following new conditions added on top of it.
- Unary minus: You can use the `-` operator as a unary operator to negate a number.
- Scientific notation: You can use the `e` or `E` character to specify a number in scientific notation (e.g., `1.23e4` is equivalent to `1.23 * 10 ** 4`).
- Constants: You can use the `pi` and `e` constants in your expressions.
- Functions: You can use the `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` functions in your expressions.
- You still can't use the `eval` function.
