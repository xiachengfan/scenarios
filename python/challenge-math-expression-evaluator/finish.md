# Summary

Congratulations, great job! You have successfully completed the programming challenge of implementing two functions to evaluate mathematical expressions. Your implementation of evaluate_expression and advanced_evaluate_expression shows a clear understanding of the shunting yard algorithm and stack-based evaluation of postfix notation. You've also done an excellent job of incorporating error handling for invalid input expressions and attempted division or modulo by zero errors in both functions. Keep up the good work, and continue to develop your skills in Python and computer science!
