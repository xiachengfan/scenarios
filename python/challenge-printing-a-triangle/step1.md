# Printing a Triangle

Write a Python function `print_triangle(height)` that takes an integer `height` as input and prints a triangle pattern made of asterisks (`*`). The first row of the triangle should have one asterisk, the second row should have two asterisks, and so on until the height of the triangle is reached.

## Example Usage

```python
>>> print_triangle(3)
*
**
***
>>> print_triangle(5)
*
**
***
****
*****
```

## TODO
