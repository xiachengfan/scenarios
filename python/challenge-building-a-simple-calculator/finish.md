# Summary

In this programming challenge, you learned how to build a simple calculator in Python. You implemented a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operation, validates the input, performs the calculation, and displays the result to the user. Additionally, the program asks the user if they want to perform another calculation, and loops until the user chooses to exit the program. Congratulations on completing this challenge!
