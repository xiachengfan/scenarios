# Perform the calculation

Once the user input has been validated, perform the calculation.

- `num1` and `num2` are string types, use the `float()` function to convert string type to float type.
- Use `if else` conditional statements to determine which operation the user wants to perform and then perform the appropriate calculation.

Please finish `perform_calculation` function in `simple_calculator.py`.
