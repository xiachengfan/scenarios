# Validate user input

Validate the user input to make sure it is correct. Check that the user has entered two numbers and a valid operation (+, -, \*, or /).

- Use the `isdigit()` method to check if a string contains only digits. In this step, string `num1` and `num2` need to be checked.
- Use the `operation not in list` syntax to check if the `operation` is valid, where `list` is ['+','-','*','/'].

If the input is invalid, print an error message and return to Step 1.

Please finish `validate_user_input` function in `simple_calculator.py`.
