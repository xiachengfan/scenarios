# Summary

The challenge was to create two Python functions that demonstrate the concepts of local and global variables, as well as nested functions and nonlocal variables. Step 1 created a function that modified a global variable defined outside the function, and Step 2 created a nested function that modified a variable in the outer scope using the nonlocal keyword.
