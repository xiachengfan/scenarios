# Understanding Local and Global Scope

## Requirements

1. Create a function called `update_global_variable()` that takes no arguments. Inside the function, define a variable called `global_var` and assign it the value of `10`. Then, print the value of `global_var`.
2. Next, define another function called `update_local_variable()` that also takes no arguments. Inside this function, define a variable called `local_var` and assign it the value of `5`. Then, print the value of `local_var`.
3. Finally, call both functions and print the value of `global_var` and `local_var` outside of the functions.
