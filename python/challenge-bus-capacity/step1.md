# Bus Capacity

Write a Python function named `max_passengers` that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two integers: the number of seats on the bus and the number of passengers on the bus. The function should return the maximum number of passengers that can be carried on a single bus.

## Example Usage

```python
>>> buses = [(50, 30), (40, 20), (60, 45)]
>>> max_passengers(buses)
20
```

## TODO

- Complete `max_passengers.py`

## Requirements

- The maximum number of passengers that can be carried on a single bus is the difference between the number of seats and the number of passengers.
