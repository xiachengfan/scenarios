# Bus Capacity

You work for a bus company and you need to create a program that calculates the maximum number of passengers that can be carried on a bus. The program should read a list of tuples that represent the number of seats and the number of passengers for each bus, and then output the maximum number of passengers that can be carried on a single bus.
