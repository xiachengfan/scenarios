# String Comparison

## Target

Implement a class MyString that takes a string as an argument to the constructor. The class should have the comparison magic methods implemented. The comparison should be based on the alphabetical order of the strings.

For example:

I get the `s1` and `s2` objects by calling the `MyString` class and output the values compared between `s1` and `s2`. The output of the `print` function should be `True`.

```python
s1 = MyString('abc')

s2 = MyString('def')

print(s1 < s2)
# Output: True
```

## Requirements

- Implement the class `MyString` in `string_concatenation.py`.
- Implement the `__eq__` magic method to concatenate two strings.
- Implement the `__ne__` magic method to concatenate two strings.
- Implement the `__lt__` magic method to concatenate two strings.
- Implement the `__le__` magic method to concatenate two strings.
- Implement the `__gt__` magic method to concatenate two strings.
- Implement the `__ge__` magic method to concatenate two strings.
