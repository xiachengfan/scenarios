# Hiking Trail

Write a Python function called `hiking_tracker` that takes in a list of hiker's names and their current location on the trail.

## Example Usage

```python
hikers = [('John', 3), ('Jane', 5), ('Bob', 8)]
print(hiking_tracker(hikers))
```

Output:

```python
{'John': 3, 'Jane': 5, 'Bob': 8}
```

## TODO

- Complete `hiking_tracker.py`

## Requirements

- The function should return a dictionary that maps each hiker's name to their current location.
