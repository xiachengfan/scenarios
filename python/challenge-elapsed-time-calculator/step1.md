# Elapsed Time Calculator

## Problem Description

Write a function called `elapsed_time` that takes two arguments: two dates (in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`), and returns the elapsed time between the two dates in days. You can assume that the second date is always greater than or equal to the first date.

## TODO

- Complete `elapsed_time.py`

## Requirements

- The input dates should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
- The output should be an integer
- The function should use the `time` module in Python

## Example Usage

```python
start_date = '2022-01-01'
end_date = '2022-01-31'
print(elapsed_time(start_date, end_date)) # 30
```
