# Set Intersection

## Introduction

The challenge is to write a Python function that takes in two sets and returns a new set containing the elements that are present in both sets. The function is named `set_intersection` and takes two sets as arguments. The output is a new set containing the intersection of the two input sets. The function uses the built-in `intersection()` method of the set class to find the intersection of the sets. The challenge also provides the input and output constraints and an example.
