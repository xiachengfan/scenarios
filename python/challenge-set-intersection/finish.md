# Summary

In this challenge, we have implemented a Python function to find the intersection of two sets. The set_intersection() function takes two sets as input and returns a new set containing the elements present in both sets. We used the built-in intersection() method of the set class to implement the function. The solution provides an efficient and easy-to-use solution to finding the intersection of sets in Python.
