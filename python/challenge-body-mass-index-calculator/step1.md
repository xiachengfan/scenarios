# Body Mass Index Calculator

Your task is to write a Python function called `calculate_bmi` that takes in two parameters:

- `weight` (a float): represents the weight of the person in kilograms.
- `height` (a float): represents the height of the person in meters.

The function should calculate the BMI of the person using the formula:$BMI = weight / (height * height)$

## Example Usage

```python
weight = 70.5
height = 1.75

bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
print(bmi)
```

Output:

```python
23.02
```

## TODO

- Complete `calculate_bmi.py`

## Requirements

- The function should return the BMI as a float value rounded to two decimal places.
