# Customized Greetings

As a software developer, you often need to write command line tools that can take in user input and perform some task based on the input. One important tool for handling command line input in Python is the `argparse` module, which provides an easy and flexible way to parse command line arguments.

In this programming challenge, you are tasked with writing a Python script that takes in a name and an optional greeting message as command line arguments, and generates a customized greeting message based on the inputs. The script should use the `argparse` module to parse the command line arguments and have proper error handling for when the `--name` argument is not provided.

This challenge will test your knowledge of Python's `argparse` module, as well as your ability to write clear and concise code with proper error handling and documentation.
