# Even Sum

## Problem Description

You are given a list of integers. Your task is to write a Python function that will find the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

## Requirements

- Write a Python function named `even_sum` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.
- The function should ignore odd numbers and only consider even numbers.
- If the list is empty, the function should return 0.

## Example Usage

```python
even_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# Output: 12

even_sum([10, 15, 20])
# Output: 30

even_sum([3, 5, 7])
# Output: 0

even_sum([])
# Output: 0
```
