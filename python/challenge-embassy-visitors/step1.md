# Embassy Visitors

Write a Python function `record_visitor(name: str, purpose: str) -> str` that takes in two parameters, `name` and `purpose`, both of which are strings. The function should return a string in the following format: `"Visitor {name} has come to the embassy for {purpose}."`.

## Example Usage

```python
>>> record_visitor("John Smith", "visa application")
"Visitor John Smith has come to the embassy for visa application."
```

## TODO

- Complete `record_visitor.py`

## Requirements

- The function should use an f-string to format the returned string.
