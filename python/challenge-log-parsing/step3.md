# Time-Consuming Statistics

Through the above two steps, we have parsed the log file and summarized the number of requests for each uri. In this step, we need to find and return the uri that takes the maximum and minimum time on average.

## Tips

- Counting the sum value using the built-in functions `sum()`.
- The second value parsed from each log line is a string that needs to be converted to a numeric type.

## TODO

- Completing `time_statistics.py`

## Requirements

- Finish your code in `time_statistics` function.
