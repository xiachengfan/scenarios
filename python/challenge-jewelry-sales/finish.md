# Summary

Congratulations on completing the challenge! Through this challenge, we have learned many valuable programming concepts, including:

- How to define functions and use type hints to specify parameter and return value types.
- How to work with collection data types such as lists and tuples.
- How to use conditional statements and exception handling to handle various error cases.
- How to use loops and conditional statements to process elements in a collection.
- How to use dictionaries to store and manipulate key-value data.

Furthermore, there are several programming best practices that are worth noting:

- When processing input data, it is important to consider edge cases and write robust code.
- When calculating average prices, it is important to use appropriate data types and operations to avoid precision issues.
- When finding the most popular product, it is important to use appropriate data structures and algorithms to improve efficiency.

Keep up the good work!
