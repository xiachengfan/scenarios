# Jewelry Sales

You work for a small business that sells handmade jewelry. They have asked you to help them create a program that will track their sales data. The business currently uses a spreadsheet to manage their sales data, but they are finding it difficult to keep up with the increasing volume of sales. Your task is to create a Python program that will process the sales data and provide useful insights to help the business make informed decisions.
