# Summary

In this task, we were asked to implement a Python function that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Based on the conversion formula, we can obtain the Celsius temperature by subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature and then multiplying the result by 5/9. The function should also use the round function to round the result to one decimal place. By completing this task, you learned how to implement a simple temperature conversion function in Python, and how to use the unittest module to write unit tests to verify the correctness of the function.
