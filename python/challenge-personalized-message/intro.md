# Personalized Message

You have been given a name and an age. Your task is to write a Python function to display a personalized message using the name and age.

f-strings (short for "formatted string literals") were introduced in Python 3.6 as a new way to format strings. They provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals, making it easier to create formatted strings.

To create an f-string, you simply prefix a string literal with the letter "f". Inside the string, you can embed expressions inside curly braces {}. The expressions are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.
