- The function should return the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
- The division operation should return a float.
- The output should be printed to the console.

## Example Usage

```
Input:
x = 6
y = 4

Output:
The sum of 6 and 4 is 10.
The difference between 6 and 4 is 2.
The product of 6 and 4 is 24.
