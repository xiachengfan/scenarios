# Summary

From this challenge, you learned several things, including:

- List and dictionary manipulation in Python: The task involves counting the number of votes for each candidate, which requires manipulating lists and dictionaries.
- String manipulation in Python: The function needs to be case-insensitive, which requires converting all the candidate names to lowercase or uppercase.
- How to handle ties: The task requires handling ties, which is a common situation in data analysis and programming. The solution involves comparing the number of votes for each candidate to determine if there is a tie.

Overall, this task provides a practical example of how to solve a real-world problem using Python programming.
