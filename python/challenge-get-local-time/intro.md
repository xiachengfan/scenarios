# Get Local Time

In today's globalized world, it is essential to be aware of the local time in different cities, especially when conducting business or traveling. In this coding challenge, you will be required to develop a program that can retrieve the local time of any city in the world, given its name.

The program you will create will take as input the name of a city in the world and return the local time in that city. To do this, your program will need to connect to an API that provides timezone information for cities around the world. You will then use the timezone information to calculate the local time in the given city.
