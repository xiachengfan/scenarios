# Solution

The `find_expressions()` function takes in a list of integers `nums` and a target value `target` as parameters. The function returns a list containing all possible mathematical expressions that can be formed by combining two integers in `nums` using the mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. If there are no valid expressions, the function returns an empty tuple.

The function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible expressions of elements that can be formed by combining two integers in `nums` using the mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. If a expressions is found that result is the `target`, the expressions will be appended in the `result` list. If no valid expression is found, the function returns an empty list.

The type hints are used to specify the expected types of the function parameters and return value. The `nums` parameter is expected to be a list of integers, and the `target` parameter is expected to be an integer. The function returns a list of strings as the mathematical expressions that can be formed by combining two integers in `nums` using the mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

Note that there is no commutative property for subtraction and division; Please take care of the handling of these cases.
