# Summary

In this challenge, you learned about Python's dictionary and list data structures, as well as the `datetime` and numeric formatting modules. We implemented a Python function `track_attendance` that calculates the attendance rate for each student from the given attendance records and returns a dictionary containing the attendance rate for each student.

We used the following concepts in our implementation:

- Python's dictionary and list data structures
- `datetime` module for handling dates
- Numeric formatting module for rounding to two decimal places.
