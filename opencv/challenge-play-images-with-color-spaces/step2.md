# Color-based Object Detection

In this sub-challenge, you will use the color space transformations to detect a specific color in an image and create a mask that highlights the detected color.

## Requirements:

Please complete the `detect_color` function in the file `/home/labex/project/detect_color.py`.
(You can use `images/img1.jpg` to test your code.)

The function should have the following signature:

1. The function takes an image and target color as inputs.
2. Convert the input image to the appropriate color space for detection.
3. Create a mask that highlights the target color in the image.
4. The function returns a masked image with the target color highlighted.
