In this Python program challenge, participants are required to use OpenCV-Python to perform template matching and draw the results. Template matching is a technique used in computer vision to find and locate a smaller image (template) within a larger image (source). This challenge will test your high-level programming skills, as well as your understanding of image processing and computer vision concepts.
