# Find Edges

Edge detection is an important technique in computer vision and image processing, used for identifying the boundaries of objects within an image. The OpenCV library is a powerful tool that provides various functions for working with images, including edge detection.

In this Python programming challenge, you will implement an edge detection application that processes images using the OpenCV library. The application will contain three sub-challenges, each focusing on a different aspect of edge detection.
