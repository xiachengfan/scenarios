# Morphological Transformations

Morphological transformations are image processing operations that process an image based on its shape. They are commonly used for tasks such as removing noise, smoothing, and enhancing edges in images. In this challenge, you will be working with the `opencv-python` library to perform various morphological transformations on images.

This challenge consists of four sub-challenges, each with a specific goal. By completing this challenge, you will gain a deeper understanding of morphological transformations and how they can be used to improve image processing tasks.
