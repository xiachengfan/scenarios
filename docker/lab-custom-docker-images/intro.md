# Custom Docker Images

## Introduction

Docker is a popular tool for packaging and distributing applications as containers. Docker images are at the heart of this process. An image is a pre-built package that contains everything needed to run an application, including the code, dependencies, and configuration. Docker images can be downloaded from public or private registries, or created locally. In this lab, you will learn how to create custom Docker images that add value to your applications by including additional software, libraries, or configurations.
