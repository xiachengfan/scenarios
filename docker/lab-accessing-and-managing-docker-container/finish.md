# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to access and manage Docker containers using the Docker CLI. We covered basic container management tasks, including starting and stopping containers, accessing container logs, executing commands inside a container, and removing containers. With these skills, you can start exploring more complex Docker container management scenarios and get hands-on experience with Docker.
