# Accessing and Managing Docker Container

Docker is a powerful tool for deploying applications in containers, which are lightweight and portable environments that can run on any system with Docker installed. In this lab, we will learn how to access and manage Docker containers using the Docker command line interface (CLI). We will cover basic container management tasks, including starting and stopping containers, accessing container logs, and executing commands inside a container.
