# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to run pods with jobs and cronjobs in Kubernetes. We started with a simple example of a pod that runs a job, and gradually built up to more complex examples of jobs with multiple pods and cronjobs that run on a regular schedule. With this knowledge, you can run various tasks that are not part of a long-running application or service in Kubernetes.
