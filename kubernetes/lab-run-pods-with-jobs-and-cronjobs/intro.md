In Kubernetes, jobs and cronjobs are used to run tasks that are not part of a long-running application or service. Jobs are used for one-off tasks, while cronjobs are used for tasks that need to be run on a regular schedule.

In this lab, we will learn how to run pods with jobs and cronjobs in Kubernetes. We will start with a simple example and gradually build up to more complex examples.
