# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to store application data with PersistentVolumes in Kubernetes. You created a PersistentVolume, deployed a simple web application that used the PersistentVolume, created a PersistentVolumeClaim to request storage from the PersistentVolume, and modified the PersistentVolumeClaim to request specific storage resources. You also verified that the data was being persisted on the PersistentVolume even if the container was terminated or moved to another node.
