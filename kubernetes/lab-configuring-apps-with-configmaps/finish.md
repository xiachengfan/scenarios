# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use ConfigMaps in Kubernetes to configure your applications. You created a ConfigMap containing configuration data, used the ConfigMap in your application, and updated the ConfigMap to see how it affects your application. You also learned how to verify that the configuration was applied to your application and how to clean up the resources created in the lab.
