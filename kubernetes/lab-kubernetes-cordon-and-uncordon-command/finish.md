# Summary

In this lab, we explored how to use the `cordon` and `uncordon` commands in Kubernetes to control the scheduling of pods on nodes. We learned how to cordoned and uncordoned nodes, even with running pods, and how to use labels to selectively cordoned and uncordoned nodes based on specific criteria. These commands are useful for managing the availability and resiliency of pods in a Kubernetes cluster.
