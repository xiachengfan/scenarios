# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use namespaces to isolate workloads and resources in a Kubernetes cluster. You created a namespace, deployed a simple web application in the namespace, exposed the web application to the outside world using a Kubernetes Service, and verified that the web application is isolated from the other resources in the cluster.
