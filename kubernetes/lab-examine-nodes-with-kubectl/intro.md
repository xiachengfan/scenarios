# Examining Nodes with Kubectl

In this lab, you will learn how to use `kubectl` to examine the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. You will start with basic node information and work your way up to more advanced topics such as taints and tolerations. This lab assumes that you have a Kubernetes cluster already set up and have `kubectl` installed.
