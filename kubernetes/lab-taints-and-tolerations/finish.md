# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use taints and tolerations to schedule pods on specific nodes. We started by creating a tainted node and verifying that pods without tolerations could not be scheduled on it. We then created a pod with tolerations and verified that it could be scheduled on the tainted node. Finally, we created a pod with multiple tolerations and verified that it could be scheduled on nodes with multiple taints.

Taints and tolerations are a powerful feature of Kubernetes that can be used to ensure that certain workloads are only scheduled on specific nodes.
