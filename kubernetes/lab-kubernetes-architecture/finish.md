# Summary

In this lab, we explored the architecture of Kubernetes, including the control plane, node, pod, and service components. We learned how to check the status of the control plane and node components using `kubectl get`, how to create a simple pod and check its status, and how to create a simple service and expose a pod to external applications. By understanding the components that make up a Kubernetes cluster and their interactions, we can better understand how Kubernetes works and how to use it to deploy and manage containerized applications.
