# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to schedule pods on specific nodes using Node Selectors and Node Affinity. We started with a simple deployment and then moved on to more complex scenarios where we used different selectors and affinity rules to schedule pods on specific nodes based on the labels assigned to those nodes.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed this lab.
