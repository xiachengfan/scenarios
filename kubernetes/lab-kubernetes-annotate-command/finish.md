# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `kubectl annotate` command to add, update, and remove annotations from Kubernetes resources. We started with simple examples of annotating a Pod with single and multiple key-value pairs, and then explored more advanced use cases, such as updating an existing annotation and annotating a different resource like a Deployment. Annotations can be a powerful tool to attach additional metadata to Kubernetes resources and provide useful information for external tools or processes.
