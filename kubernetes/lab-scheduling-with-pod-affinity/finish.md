# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use pod affinity to influence the scheduling of pods based on the presence or absence of other pods or labels on nodes. We created pods with pod affinity, anti-affinity, node affinity, and combinations of both. Pod affinity is a powerful feature of Kubernetes that can be used to optimize the performance and resource utilization of our workloads.
