# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to control access to resources and operations within the cluster. You created a namespace, a Role, and a Role Binding to control access to resources in a specific namespace. You also created a ClusterRole and a ClusterRole Binding to control access to resources across all namespaces. By the end of this lab, you should have a good understanding of how to use RBAC to control access to resources and operations in a Kubernetes cluster.
