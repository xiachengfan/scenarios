# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use ContainerProbe in Kubernetes. We created a deployment, added a liveness probe, tested the liveness probe, added a readiness probe, and tested the readiness probe. By using ContainerProbe, we can ensure that our containers are ready to accept traffic and are functioning correctly.
