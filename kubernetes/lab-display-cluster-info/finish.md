# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `cluster-info` command, which provides information about the Kubernetes cluster. We learned how to get the Kubernetes cluster information, components information, services information, nodes information, pods information, events information, endpoints information, storage classes information, and persistent volumes information. By using these commands, you can get a better understanding of the Kubernetes cluster's state and diagnose issues in the cluster.
