# Kubernetes Proxy Command

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Kubernetes proxy command to access the Kubernetes API server from your local machine. You will start with simple examples and gradually increase in complexity until you have a fully functional proxy.

The Kubernetes proxy command allows you to access the Kubernetes API server from your local machine without needing to expose the API server to the public internet. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters.
