# Delete a StatefulSet

In Kubernetes, you can delete a StatefulSet by running the following command:

```shell
kubectl delete statefulset web
```

This will delete the `web` StatefulSet and all of its pods.

Congratulations, you have completed the lab on modelling stability with StatefulSets in Kubernetes!
